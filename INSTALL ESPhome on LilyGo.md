# ESPHome Installation and Flashing Guide

### LilyGO T-CAN485 and Marstek Battery

This guide explains how to install ESPHome on **Windows or Linux** and flash it onto a **LilyGO T-CAN485** to communicate with **Marstek RS485 batteries** using a custom ESPHome configuration.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher (on Windows or Linux)
- USB-C cable (must support data transfer)
- LilyGO T-CAN485 development board
- ESPHome YAML configuration file (`Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml`)
- Internet connection (for dependency installation)
- **USB Drivers** (Windows only - see below)

---

## USB Driver Installation (Windows Only)

The LilyGO T-CAN485 uses a **CH9102** or **CP2104** USB-to-Serial chip. Install the appropriate driver:

### CH9102 Driver (most common)

- **Download**: [CH9102 Driver (WCH Official)](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH343SER_EXE.html)
- Alternative: [CH341SER Driver](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH341SER_EXE.html)

### CP210x Driver (alternative)

- **Download**: [Silicon Labs CP210x Driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

**Installation Steps:**

1. Download and run the driver installer
2. Restart your PC
3. Connect the LilyGO board via USB-C
4. Check Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT)
5. You should see a new COM port (e.g., COM3, COM5)

> Linux drivers are usually included in the kernel.

---

## ESPHome Installation

Use ESPHome 2026.9 or newer for this configuration.

### Windows

Open PowerShell or CMD:

    # Step 1: Upgrade pip
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

    # Step 2: Install ESPHome
    python -m pip install --upgrade esphome

    # Step 3: Verify installation
    esphome version

ESPHome installs PlatformIO as a dependency; it does not need to be installed separately.

---

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)

Open a terminal:

    # Step 1: Install Python and pip
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip

    # Step 2: Upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

    # Step 3: Install ESPHome
    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade esphome

    # Step 4: Verify installation
    esphome version

If `esphome` is not found after installation, add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`:

>     echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
>     source ~/.bashrc

---

## ESPHome Commands

Below are essential commands for managing your ESPHome project:

    # Show installed ESPHome version
    esphome version

    # Clean previous build files (recommended before first compile)
    esphome clean "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml"

    # Compile only (check for errors without flashing)
    esphome compile "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml"

    # Compile and flash via USB
    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml"

    # Open ESPHome Dashboard (web interface)
    esphome dashboard

The first flash must be done via USB. Subsequent updates can be sent over the air.

---

## First USB Flash

### Step 1: Connect the Board

1. Connect the LilyGO T-CAN485 to your PC using a USB-C cable
2. **If Windows**: Wait for driver installation to complete
3. **If the board is not detected**:
   - Unplug the board
   - Hold the **BOOT** button
   - While holding BOOT, plug in the USB cable
   - Release BOOT after 2 seconds
   - The board should now appear as a COM port

### Step 2: Flash the Firmware

    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml"

**What happens:**

1. ESPHome compiles the firmware
2. Automatically detects the COM port (or prompts you to select)
3. Uploads the firmware to the board
4. Shows live serial logs

### Step 3: Manual Port Selection (if needed)

If auto-detection fails, specify the port manually:

    # Windows example:
    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml" --device COM3

    # Linux example:
    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml" --device /dev/ttyUSB0

**Find your COM port:**

- **Windows**: Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT)
- **Linux**: Run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` or `ls /dev/ttyACM*`

---

## After the First Flash

Once the initial USB flash succeeds:

The device will:

- Connect to Wi-Fi (configured in your `secrets.yaml`)
- Become available for **OTA updates** (no USB needed)
- Show up in Home Assistant (if ESPHome integration is installed)

### ESPHome Dashboard

Start the ESPHome Dashboard to manage your devices via web browser:

    esphome dashboard

- Opens at: [**http://localhost:6052**](http://localhost:6052)
- Shows all your ESPHome devices
- Upload updates via web interface
- View logs in real-time

### OTA Updates (Over-The-Air)

After the first USB flash, update wirelessly:

    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml" --device marstek.local

Or use the IP address:

    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml" --device 192.168.1.xxx

---

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues

**Device not detected or no COM port**

- Install CH9102 or CH341 driver (see section above)
- Check Device Manager for "Unknown Device" with yellow warning
- Try a different USB cable (must support data, not charge-only)
- Try different USB ports (use USB 2.0 ports if USB 3.0 fails)
- Hold BOOT button while connecting

**Access denied or permission error**

- Close any serial monitor tools (Arduino IDE, PuTTY, etc.)
- Disable antivirus temporarily
- Run PowerShell/CMD as Administrator

**COM port appears but flashing fails**

- Unplug the board
- Hold BOOT button + plug in + release after 2 seconds
- Try again with manual port: `--device COMx`

---

### Linux Issues

**Permission denied: /dev/ttyUSB0**

Add your user to the `dialout` group:

    sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER

**Important:** Log out and log back in (or reboot) for changes to take effect.

**Device not found**

Check which port the board is using:

    ls /dev/ttyUSB*
    ls /dev/ttyACM*

Then specify manually:

    esphome run "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml" --device /dev/ttyUSB0

---

### General Issues

**Compilation fails**

- Run `esphome clean "Marstek Lilygo ESPHome Config.yaml"` first
- Check your internet connection (ESPHome downloads dependencies)
- Verify Python version: `python --version` (requires 3.8 or higher)
- Update ESPHome: `pip3 install esphome --upgrade`

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'esphome'`**

- Reinstall ESPHome: `python -m pip install --upgrade esphome`
- Check if pip installed to correct Python: `python -m pip show esphome`

**OTA upload fails**

- Verify the device is powered on and connected to Wi-Fi
- Check device IP address in your router
- Ping the device: `ping marstek.local` or `ping 192.168.1.xxx`
- Check `secrets.yaml` for correct WiFi credentials
- Reflash via USB if OTA is completely broken

**ESPHome Dashboard does not open**

- Check if port 6052 is already in use
- Try: `esphome dashboard --open-ui`
- Access manually: Open browser and go to `http://localhost:6052`
